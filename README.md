## Overview

The Flight Declaration protocol aims to facilitate the secure exchange of flight situation data between UTM Providers. It was originally developed by the Altitude Angel team who offered it as a contribution to the Global UTM Association's data exchange initiative in February 2017.

The Global UTM Association is committed to the advancement and adoption of technical systems and standards which promote the safe integration of drones into the airspace.

As part of the association's commitment to this goal, we have prepared this protocol specification to solve a vital safety problem affecting all UTM Providers today: the ability to securely share important 
safety information with each other, while retaining strict privacy controls.
